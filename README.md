# Real-time Reactive Streams

The Real-time Reactive Streams interface, and example Real-time Specification for Java (RTSJ) implementations.

Real-time Reactive Streams extend the proposed Java 9 Reactive Streams model and integrate it with the Real-Time Specification for Java. The approach leverages a real-time version of the Java 8 Stream processing framework. Our approach addresses the major issue when using Reactive Streams in real-time: there is no way to set the timeout.
